 * Re-run an account-scoped loader when the local account generation advances.
 *
 * The generation only moves on a real account boundary — login, logout, a remote
 * account replacement, a refresh that discovered a different server family — never on
 * a same-family token rotation. Route loaders that hold account-scoped data
 * (dashboard calendars and feed, calendar settings, admin lists) use this to clear and
 * reload only their own data when the identity changes, which is what replaces the
 * old whole-document reload on a session-restored broadcast. Public/participant views
 * keep their public payload, protected-route auth checks are untouched, and the
 * reload only fires once the replacement identity has been confirmed (/auth/me has
 * re-populated the signed-in user), so the loader never runs against a cleared store.
