 * Bring a tab that just accepted another tab's fresh login into agreement with it.

 * The HTTP client installed the new access token but pinia still describes the
 * previous (or no) account. Drop the old account-scoped state, then hydrate /auth/me
 * so the UI and router guard reflect the account whose token outgoing requests now
 * carry.
 *
 * The accepted server family travels with the event and fences the round trip: `/auth/me`
 * commits — and on failure clears the token — only while that family is still the accepted
 * one, so a slower response for an older session cannot overwrite (or evict) a newer one.
 *
 * Deliberately **no document reload** (the fork's approach caused reload loops on
 * session-restored broadcasts, audit B5/B5q). Dropping the owner-scoped stores makes
 * the change visible immediately — public/participant pages lose the previous owner's
 * cached data on the spot — and the account-generation bump the reset performs is what
 * account-scoped route loaders (dashboard calendars/feed, calendar settings, admin
 * lists) watch to clear and reload only their own data once the new identity confirms.
 * Protected-route auth checks are unchanged.
