/**
 * The three concepts that describe a browser session, kept deliberately apart:
 *
 *  1. **Server family / session id** (`session_id` on every auth response). Identity of
 *     a refreshable login session: stable across refresh, brand-new on a new login. The
 *     client holds it in memory, shares it over the BroadcastChannel, and it alone
 *     tells "a newer token for the session I already have" from "a new login".
 *  2. **Access token + absolute expiry**. Short-lived credential state, updated in
 *     memory when a token for the same family rotates; the proactive refresh timer is
 *     replaced with the newer token's due time.
 *  3. **Local account generation** (`sessionGeneration` here; `accountFence.ts` for the
 *     stores). An in-memory fence that invalidates old async work — queued retries,
 *     in-flight refreshes, delayed responses — after a logout or account replacement.
 *
 * A same-family rotation is *not* a new login: it replaces the token and restarts the
 * refresh timer without clearing the account stores, fetching /auth/me again, bumping
 * the generation, navigating or re-broadcasting. A different finalized family, or an
 * explicit logout, advances the generation and fences all pending work.
